# Ollama zsh completion plugin for Antidote

The plugin is based on [Obeone's Gist](https://gist.github.com/obeone/9313811fd61a7cbb843e0001a4434c58) 

# installation

With [Antidote](https://github.com/mattmc3/antidote) installation is as simple as editing my `~/.zsh_plugins.txt` file and adding:

```sh
ocodo/ollama_zsh_completion
```

Then reload the shell (I just start a new terminal window) but you can also:

```sh 
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Completion

Command completion for all `ollama` cli commands, [see the original gist for more info](https://gist.github.com/obeone/9313811fd61a7cbb843e0001a4434c58)
